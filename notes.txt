Notes for project

1. 2^16=65536 bytes
read from a file containting LOGICAL ADDRESSES
using TLB and page table 
will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical addreses.
and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.
The goal is to simulate the STEPS involved in translating logical to physical address.

1. be able to read from BOTH files
====

NOTE Given 32-bit numbers, take 16bits of each logical address
16-8 = PAGE_NUMBER
8-0 = OFFSET

==End part of output
Number of Translated Addresses = 1000
Page Faults = 244
Page Fault Rate = 0.244
TLB Hits = 54
TLB Hit Rate = 0.054
======
FIRST VALUE of 20 is correct
2^8 entries on page table
page size of 2^8 bytes

16 entries on TLB
Frame size of 2^8 bytes
